# Heart-Sounds-Classification
Classifying heart-sounds data (audio) into one of the four categories (3 disease and 1 Normal) using CNN.

The dataset is comprised of two directories:
1. Training
2. Validation
Each contain four subdirectories consisting of four cateogories, 3 types of abnormal heart-sounds and 1 normal heart sound.

# There are two steps for the classification model to work:
Step 1. Conversion of .wav audio files into spectrogram image .png files.
Step 2. Classification of the spectrograms formed using the CNN model.
